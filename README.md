# ChadMaths

ChadMaths represents the next generation of math learning tools, evolving significantly beyond the capabilities of QuickMaths. While it can be considered version 3 of QuickMaths, the planned enhancements are so substantial that it warranted the creation of an entirely new project.

## Features

ChadMaths offers a robust set of features designed to enhance the learning experience:

- **Mental Calculus**: Comprehensive mental calculus questions and logic to challenge and improve mental math skills.
- **Graph Questions**: A variety of graph-related questions that cover key mathematical concepts.
  - **Extreme Points**: Identify low and high points on graphs.
  - **Turning/Saddle Points**: Determine points where the graph changes direction.
  - **Median or Local Ascent**: Analyze the median or local ascent of functions.
  - **Zeros**: Find the zeros of functions.
  - **Y Axial Intercept**: Identify where the function intersects the Y-axis.
  - **Intervals**: Various types of interval-related questions to deepen understanding.
  - **Linear Functions**: Exercises on linear functions.
  - **2nd Grade Functions**: Problems involving second-degree functions.
  - **3rd Grade Functions**: Challenges with third-degree functions.
